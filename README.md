# Atlan

Project is live at : https://atlan-lac.vercel.app/

## Project overview

The project is a web-based SQL query playground that allows users to enter, execute, and save SQL queries. It primarily focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with SQL queries and visualizing the query results.

### Key features
* Query Execution and Visualization: Users can enter custom SQL queries in an input field. Upon clicking the "Search" button, the application fetches data from a predefined dataset using GraphQL and displays the query results in a tabular format.

* Predefined Queries: Users have the option to select from a list of predefined queries. These queries are presented in a dropdown menu, making it easy for users to explore specific queries without typing them manually.

* Query History: The application keeps track of the last five executed queries in a history section. Users can refer to their recent queries and revisit them quickly.

* Query Saving: Users can save queries for future reference. The application allows users to save up to 10 queries. Saved queries are visually differentiated with a star icon in the UI.

* CSV Data Parsing: The application fetches data from a remote CSV file, parses it, and presents it in a tabular format. The data is presented using HTML tables, showing rows and columns with appropriate headers.

* Loading Indicator: While fetching and processing data, a loading indicator is displayed to inform users that the application is working on fetching the results.

* Visual Enhancements: The user interface features an Atlan logo and aesthetic elements, including icons, buttons, and layout design, to provide a visually appealing experience.
